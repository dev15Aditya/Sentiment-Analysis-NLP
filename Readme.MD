The project aims to classify tweets as either positive, negative, or neutral using various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The main focus of the project is to demonstrate how to preprocess textual data, extract relevant features from it, and train machine learning models for sentiment analysis.

The repository contains several Python files, including a data preprocessing script, a feature extraction script, a machine learning model building script, and an evaluation script. The data preprocessing script includes various steps such as cleaning the data, removing stopwords, and stemming the words. The feature extraction script includes the implementation of various techniques such as Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec. The machine learning model building script includes the implementation of different machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM, and compares their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The evaluation script generates a confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

The repository also includes a Jupyter notebook that provides a step-by-step explanation of the project, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, and evaluation. Additionally, the notebook includes visualizations of the data, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.

Overall, this project is a good example of how to perform sentiment analysis using NLP techniques in Python and could be useful for anyone interested in learning about this topic, particularly in the context of social media data.
